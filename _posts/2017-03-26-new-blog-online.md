I have a Chinese blog [Jian-Ching 學習筆記](//jian-ching.blogspot.com) at blogger since 2014-02-20.
First, it's fine, but I found that need spends much time to modify HTML and CSS style for programming code highlight,
font size...etc. It's sad, so I stop continue write post.

One day, I write to document with markdown, found a magic item call [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
Jekyll is static site generator, can transform markdown into a static blog.

Since 2017-02-09 start tries Jekyll to make this blog.
Jekyll is writing by Ruby, I don't want to host install Ruby,
so study Dockerfile to install Jekyll environment in the container.

In the process, I study Dockerfile to build container images and Linux command line about docker.
How to install Ruby and gem for Jekyll.
Choice a Jekyll theme for here, It's [minimal-mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
Actually, it's also spending more time, but I learning much from the process, so I think this is worth it.

Finally, the new blog is online.
I went to improve my English skill, so the blog will write English.
If you find any worse, tell me please, I would be very grateful.
